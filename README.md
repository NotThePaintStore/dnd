# D&D Campaign Notes

### Notes

- PLANAR TRAVEL IS COMMON
- Celestial armies guard the gates to the outer planes.
- Tharizdun was the original god of death, but the Raven Queen mortally wounded him and cast him into the Far Realm to die. This knowledge has been forgotten by all except the Twins and the Raven Queen herself. The mind of the Mad God now spawns Aberrations that plague the world.
- The world is flat. When sailing off the edge of the map, one sails to a new world entirely. North: Innistrad, East: Eberron, South: Forgotten Realms, West: Zendikar (sealed off).
- The portal to Zendikar appears as an immensely dense fog, and the seal is composed of millions of magic runes that appear when within 100ft of the barrier and glow a faint blue. The barrier itself has one thousand hit points and is immune to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons; if it takes more than 100 points of damage, a Deva (or angelic being of appropriate CR) will arrive to defend it. Casting Dispel Magic at level 9 with a successful roll of 20 or removing all its hit points will destroy the barrier for a half-mile in each direction; this damage repairs itself in 10 days.
- Sarenrae the Everlight? (NG)(Life, Light)
- Sarenrae is known as the Lost Child. During the Sundering, she was kidnapped by Vecna and she is his best-kept secret. Her real name is forgotten in the mortal realms.
- Use symbols from Tal’Dorei Campaign Guide?
- Ethereal Plane = Spatial Sea; Astral Plane = Temporal Sea (Sea of Stars?)
- Etherguard: joint military force surrounding the Ghostlands; their role is to keep the ghosts away from the populated cities and towns. Each kingdom contributes men to the Etherguard annually.
- The Archangels (or Ahura Mazda (celestial for “Holy Immortals”)) are the 4 Solars that are Pelor’s highest-ranked servants and personal guard. Their names are Uriel, Mikael, Israfil, and Azrael.

### Lore
Corellon, king of the elves, sired two daughters, Avandra and Sehanine, through Melora. He also created the elves; when his blood spilled on the ground, the elves arose.

Erathis and Melora have a tempestuous love affair. When there is balance in the world, they get along, but when civilization or wilderness run rampant, there is conflict. Also, Erathis does not get along with Corellon, Avandra, or Sehanine due to Melora’s unfaithfulness with Corellon.

The Raven Queen was born a mortal. She gained the knowledge to ascend to godhood and slew the previous god of death shortly after the Sundering; his name has been lost to the annals of time. As a result, all the gods regard her with a sense of distrust.

Bahamut and Tiamat brought dragons into the world. First were the metallic dragons, then followed the chromatic dragons. Bahamut favored those with metallic scales and neglected his chromatic children; Tiamat grew jealous and led the chromatic dragons away to live by themselves.

When Tiamat and the chromatic dragons opened hostilities on Bahamut, he created the metallic Dragonborn to fight with him and his dragons. Tiamat tried to copy his creation, but ended up creating Kobolds, but a group of Kobold spies were eventually able to steal the secrets of creating Dragonborn for Tiamat, and she got her chromatic army.

Pelor has sought after Sehanine for millennia, but she does not share his affections, and so the sun chases the moon across the sky each and every day.

Zehir was defeated and imprisoned during the Sundering deep beneath a tropical island in the equatorial sea.

### Lesser Deities & Demigods

**Kurtulmak, Lieutenant of Tiamat**

Kurtulmak was the Kobold who brought Tiamat the knowledge of Dragonborn during the Dragon Wars; as a reward, she granted him great strength and immortality, and set him as one of her lieutenants. He was later tricked and imprisoned by Garl Glittergold in an endless underground maze while trying to recover an artifact Garl had stolen from Tiamat’s lair in the Nine Hells.

**Garl Glittergold, Lord of Gnomes**

**Bal-Halar (celestial for “Divine Blood”)**

Demigod (Empyrean); son of the god Pelor and human mother, Eden. Centuries ago, he was the ruler of a mighty nation at the center of the continent. He grew too prideful and sought to overthrow Pelor. Pelor himself saw to the end of that, annihilating the capital city and cursing the land by planting his colossal spear in the center of the palace. Generally thought to be dead, he was exiled to the frozen North in solitude, where he could not exert influence over lesser beings.

**Primus, Steward of Mechanus**

Primus only desires one thing: perfect law and order. As such, he oversees the operation of Mechanus, domain of Erathis. He created the Modrons, and also created the automatons that manage Sigil.

**Bast, Patron of Felines**

**Tyr, the First Knight**

**Talos, the Hand of the Stormlord**

**Moloch, Former Archdevil of Malbolge**

**Scheherazade, Lady of the Lake**

Guardian of a legendary sword that rests at the bottom of a lake.

### Races

### Key Events

**The Sundering**

A fierce war between the gods that nearly destroyed the multiverse. Neutral deities sided with those of good alignment. Resulted in the deactivation of the Gate-Towns and the gods withdrawing to the outer planes.

**Destruction of the Haladine Empire**

When Pelor cast out Bal-Halar and destroyed the city of Haladine, the continental empire fractured, and many of the larger cities became independent city-states or new kingdoms.

### Key Locations

**The All-Forge**

In the heart of a great volcano lies the All-Forge, where Moradin himself crafted some of the most exquisite and powerful artifacts.

**Dragon’s Roost**

A mountain that stands alone to the north. At the top of this mountain, which pierces the clouds as the tallest in the world, lies the dragon-cave once shared by the Dragon Lords.

**Sigil, the City of Doors**

Deep beneath the western ocean rests the lost city of Sigil. During the Sundering, the oceans churned sinking the city in the process. Over time, it has fallen to legend for the peoples of the material plane. Extraplanar travelers are quite familiar with it though. The city is stewarded by clockwork soldiers and automatons.

**The Ghostlands**

The land surrounding the Dead City, including the Silent Forest. It is perpetually overcast with storm clouds; thunder rumbles constantly, and red lightning frequently strikes the desolate terrain. Green spirits can be seen drifting up towards the heavens, only to be sucked into the vortex of the storm, and cast down into the earth through the great spear which towers over the landscape.

**The Dead City**

Bal-Halar’s former capital city, Haladine. The people who dwelt there are cursed, cut off from the gods until the curse is lifted (only removed by Pelor, or a Wish spell).

**The Silent Forest**

Petrified forest along the eastern edge of the Ghostlands. At the center of the forest is the Maiden’s 

**Eden, the Wondrous Valley**

Beneath the snow and ice of the arctic desert rests a tropical paradise and thriving city. This is the new domain of Bal-Halar, lord of the former Haladine Empire. The subterranean landscape is fertile thanks to the will of the Empyrean lord, and the denizens of his realm include outcasts, refugees, wanderers, deserters, or anyone else who did not find a home in society above the surface; as such, they have a fierce loyalty toward their emperor and god.

**_____, Den of the Pirate Mother**

**Fire Mountain**

**The Temple of Winds**

**Gate-Towns**

Before the Sundering, these towns each held a gate to one of the outer planes. With extraplanar travel shut down, these towns have fallen into disrepair and neglect, with only a fraction of the original populations remaining to maintain the temples to the gods.

**Firestorm Peak**

Mountain Island at the southern edge of the world. It was here that a group of ancient elf mages opened a portal to the Far Realm. The incomprehensible power that poured out destroyed the elves and set the island and surrounding sea ablaze with black flames that still burn today. It is also said that, with a large enough spyglass, one can see wild aberrations dancing on its shores amidst the flames.

**Sharktooth Archipelago**

### Significant Figures

**Madaura, the Pirate Mother**

The Pirate Mother takes poor children from the ships and towns that her ships plunder, and brings them under her spell, changing their minds so she is viewed as their mother. She then raises them as her own. Only children can join her crews because only children can be manipulated by her magic.

### Interesting NPCs
- Tabaxi merchant who is also secretly a catnip dealer.
- Chauvanist cowboy military leader.

### Magic Items

**Cloak of the Dragon Mage**

A cloak that shimmers like the scales of any color of dragon. Wearing the cloak grants the wearer the ability to use dragon breath weapons like a dragonborn. The wearer can spend a short rest concentrating on the cloak to change it to a new color, thereby changing the breath weapon they wield. (Rare, Requires attunement.)

**Belt of Dragon-Kin**

A belt of dragon leather that increases your Strength score by 2 (to a maximum of 20)

### Factions/Organizations/Guilds

**The Order of Dragon Knights**

**The Cult of the Dragon**

**The Shadowed Hand (Thieves' Guild)**

**The Hawk-Lords of Felderwind**

**The Emerald Enclave**

### Potential Plot Hooks

- If one of the characters is a noble, a rival will put out a contract for the PC to be killed.
- If a PC acquires a Cloak of the Dragon Mage, they will be drawn into conflict with either the Cult of the Dragon or the Order of Dragon Knights.
