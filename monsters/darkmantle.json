From a distance, it can pass itself off as a stalactite or a lump of stone. Then it drops from the ceiling and unfurls, surrounding itself with magical darkness as it engulfs and crushes its prey."

Thriving in that dark realm, they fill an ecological niche similar to bats on the Material Plane. Intelligent creatures of the Shadowfell sometimes train darkmantles as guardians or companions."

The darkmantle's speed also becomes 0, it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed, and it moves with the target. <br>A creature can detach the darkmantle by making a successful DC l3 Strength check as an action. On its turn, the darkmantle can detach itself from the target by using 5 feet of movement."
