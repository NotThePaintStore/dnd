## Contributing

There are several ways to contribute to this project:
- Improve the code and open a PR!
  I am not an expert front end developer, I'm certain there are better ways of doing things.
- Submit a bug report or request a feature in the Issue Tracker!
- Add to the monster catalog!
  1. Add your initials to the entries in the [catalog](https://git.bmoore.xyz/ben/5e_monster_manual/src/master/CATALOG.md).
  2. Open a PR (with WIP) to reserve your space.
  3. Update your PR with all additions to the catalog.
  4. Remove WIP from the PR so I know it's ready for review.
